MATLAB Simulation to validate the adaptive controller designed in this project.
The adaptive controller produces an estimate of  movement of the ground vehicle and provides a feed-forward compensation during the landing maneuver. The controller tracks a moving vehicle with higher precision than conventional controllers like PID.
The ground vehicle moves along trajectories with different properties such as sinusoid and circle. The velocity of the vehicle varies rapidly for these trajectories. The noise in vehicle's position after object detection from camera images is modeled as a Gaussian of mean zero and standard deviation of 0.1 meters. Similarly, the noise in quadrotor's velocity after state estimation from IMU is modeled as a Gaussian of mean zero and standard deviation of 0.05 m/s.
